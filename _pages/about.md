I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student doing research with the [Princeton HCI Group](https://hci.princeton.edu/), advised by Prof. [Parastoo Abtahi](https://parastooabtahi.com/). I completed my undergrad in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) at the [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). <br/>
<br/>
My current research work spans VR/AR, HRI, and multimodal input, with a focus on creating immersive experiences that blend virtuality and reality. I am grateful for the [Grace Hopper Scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/) and the Yu-Lin Scholarship support. <br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I enjoy drawing, baking, and 3D modeling :)
