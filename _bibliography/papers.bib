abstract = {Impact events, which generate directional forces with extremely short impulse durations and large force magnitudes, are prevalent in both virtual reality (VR) games and real-world experiences. However, despite recent advancement in ungrounded force feedback technologies, such as air jet propulsion and propellers, these technologies remain 5-100x weaker and 10-500x slower compared to real-world impact events. For instance, they can only achieve 4N with a minimal duration of 50-500ms compared to the 20-400N forces generated within 1-5ms for baseball, ping-pong, drumming, and tennis. To overcome these limitations, we present AirCharge, a novel haptic device that accumulates air propulsion momentum to generate instantaneous, directional impact forces. By mounting compressed air jets on rotating swingarms, AirCharge can amplify impact force magnitude by more than 10x while matching real-world impulse duration of 3ms. To support high-frequency impacts, we explored and evaluated a series of device designs, culminating in a novel reciprocating dual-swingarm design that leverages a reversing bevel gearbox to eliminate gyro effects and to achieve impact feedback of up to 10Hz. User experience evaluation (n = 16) showed that AirCharge significantly enhanced realism and is preferred by participants compared to air jets without the charging mechanism.},

abstract = {We present UltraBat, an interactive 3D side-scrolling game inspired by Flappy Bird, in which the game character, a bat, is physically levitated in mid-air using ultrasound. Players aim to navigate the bat through a stalagmite tunnel that scrolls to one side as the bat travels, which is implemented using a pin-array display to create a shape-changing passage.},

abstract = {Emerging electrochromic (EC) materials have advanced the frontier of thin-film, low-power, and non-emissive display technologies. While suitable for wearable or textile-based applications, current EC display systems are manufactured in fixed, pre-designed patterns that hinder the potential of reconfigurable display technologies desired by on-skin interactions. To realize the customizable and scalable EC display for skin wear, this paper introduces ECSkin, a construction toolkit composed of modular EC films. Our approach enables reconfigurable designs that display customized patterns by arranging combinations of premade EC modules. An ECSkin device can pixelate patterns and expand the display area through tessellating congruent modules. We present the fabrication of flexible EC display modules with accessible materials and tools. We performed technical evaluations to characterize the electrochromic performance and conducted user evaluations to verify the toolkit's usability and feasibility. Two example applications demonstrate the adaptiveness of the modular display on different body locations and user scenarios.},
